The file include a machine learning for predicting the inflation rates in kenya using the multiple linear regression model.
The dataset contains 4 independent variables(CPI rates, GDP Growth rates, Lending rates and Exchange rates) and 1 dependent variable(Inflation rates) measured annually. the data runs from 1971 to 2022.
The machine learning process include data cleanng, data visualizations, model fitting and a user interface where obe can input the values of the independent variables and get the predicted value for annual inflation rates.
Recommendation for further studies include trying out other models for predicting the annual inflation rates
